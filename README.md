## Description

This project was completed for a coding bootcamp challenge assignment. It utilizes mongoose and express to create models, schema and API routes for a social networking app through which users can post react and add friends.

After working with sql to create schema and models I found that mongoose was much easier to work with. Removing friends was the route I struggled with the most.
